This is the landing page for BreakICT, a CTF started out of Wichita, KS!

Upon commencement of the competition, this site will be updated to reflect the current competition(s) being run, and where to access them.

The previous years of the CTF have been home to several challenge types hosted on a jeopardy style platform. This year will follow a similar format. Challenge categories normally consist of Web, Reversing, Network, Osint, and Miscellaneous challenges.
